    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tbps unsulphured or dark molasses</li>
        <li>1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbps baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 cups old-fashioned whole rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup raisins</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment,
            cream the softened butter and both sugars together on medium speed until
            smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and mix on high until combined,
            about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
            Add the vanilla and molasses and mix on high until combined. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt
            together. Add to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Beat
            in the oats, raisins, and walnuts (if using) on low speed. Dough will be
            thick, yet very sticky. Chill the dough for 30-60 minutes in the
            refrigerator (do the full hour if you’re afraid of the cookies spreading
            too much). If chilling for longer (up to 2 days), allow to sit at room
            temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with
            parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll balls of dough (about 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie) and
            place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. I recommend using a cookie
            scoop since the dough can be sticky.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes until lightly browned on the sides. The
            centers will look very soft and under-baked. Remove from the oven and
            let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire
            rack to cool completely. The cookies will continue to “set” on the
            baking sheet during this time.</li>
    </ol>
